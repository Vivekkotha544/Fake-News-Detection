## Introduction

The rapid spread of fake news has become a significant issue worldwide, leading to misinformation and confusion. This project aims to address this problem by developing a machine learning system that can automatically detect fake news. By analyzing the language and sources of news articles, our models can differentiate between true and false news.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
    cd fake-news-detection
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing

Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data for model training:

```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py
```

### Model Training

Train the machine learning models using the preprocessed data:

```bash
python src/model_training.py
```

### Model Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the trained models:

```bash
python src/model_evaluation.py
```

## Datasets

The datasets used in this project are:

- **Train Dataset:** Contains labeled news articles for training the models.
- **Test Dataset:** Contains labeled news articles for testing the models.

Both datasets include features such as the news title, text, and label (real or fake).

## Models

I have implemented several machine learning models to detect fake news, including:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Deep Learning Models (LSTM, CNN)**

## Results

The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results and comparisons are available in the `model_evaluation.ipynb` notebook.
